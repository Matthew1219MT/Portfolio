        "description": "The key concept of Study War is to create a challenging and replayable experience that combines traditional roguelike game mechanics with retro-style pixel graphics. This includes designing the game with procedural generation, permanent death, resource management, exploration and discovery, and pixel art style features. Procedural generation is an important aspect of gameplay, as it generates random levels, enemies, props and other game elements to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. This ensures that each game session is unique and challenging for the player. Permadeath is another important gameplay mechanic that creates high-stakes gameplay and encourages players to learn from their mistakes and improve their skills. This also adds to the replayability of the game as players will want to keep trying to go deeper into the dungeon or unlock more different weapons and monsters. Resource management requires players to carefully manage their resources and decide to enter all rooms to gain more currency or enter fewer rooms to maintain a healthy blood level. This can add a strategic aspect to the gameplay. Exploration and discovery are also essential, as they encourage players to explore and discover new areas, enemies, and props. This can generate new strategies and possibilities to help players advance further in the game. In short, the key concept of Study War is to create a challenging and immersive experience that encourages players to experiment, explore and improve their skills while combining classic roguelike gameplay mechanics with retro-style graphics.",
